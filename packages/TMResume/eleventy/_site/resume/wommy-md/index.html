<h3>__ Summary</h3>
<p>Doing websites since college really got me acquainted with the terminal and command line. From there, building my own computers and running linux on them was a breeze. Getting to the bottom of problems is my expertise.  In my last two jobs I swiftfully learned industries I was not familiar with, with my favorite part of both of them being the customers.</p>
<p><strong>Four Year Goal</strong>: to manage ecommerce for a digital media company</p>
<p><strong>hobbies</strong>: cycling, martial arts, dancing, techno</p>

<h3>__ Experience</h3>
<h5>Hydro Capitol, Sales Associate <br> --- 2019 Winter-Spring</h5>
<p>served ~30 managers of ~50 accounts, customers and distributors<br>
troubleshot customer problems/requirements and provided solutions<br>
learned various brands and the use of their different product lines<br>
as well as their inventory software and all the inner workings of it<br>

<h5>mc chris, Road Manager <br> --- 2018 Fall</h5>

<h5>Solution People, Lead Website Engineer <br> --- 2015-2017</h5>
<p>I interned here in college and they kept me on for a couple years after. This business had 30+ websites each angled towards a different market. My job was to make the slight tweaks and updates to each one when new data come out. I did a couple redesigns, combined a few together, split other ones out, wrote a couple of scripts to streamline common methods.</p>
<h5>Original Graphics Printing, Contractor <br> --- 2015 Summer-Fall</h5>
<p>I worked out of a print shop on the south side of Chicago who served a bunch of small local businesses doing visual branding: signs, decals for cars and windows, tshirts, and etc. I was brought on to add a website element to this. Because of the rate at which they acquired new clients, my website game morphed from updating a few dozen sites a couple times a week, to creating a new site from scratch and getting it perfect in a week or two.</p>
<h5>techomad, Founder <br> --- since 2010</h5>
<p>I started this business in college, during my transition out of art school: most of my friends were artists with loads of branding experience, but needed a platform to display and market their craft. Recently my clients have been more small businesses.</p>
