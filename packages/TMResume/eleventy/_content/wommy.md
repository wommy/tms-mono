### __ Summary

  Doing websites since college really got me acquainted with the terminal and command line. From there, building my own computers and running linux on them was a breeze. Getting to the bottom of problems is my expertise.  In my last two jobs I swiftfully learned industries I was not familiar with, with my favorite part of both of them being the customers.

**Four Year Goal**: to manage ecommerce for a digital media company

**hobbies**: cycling, martial arts, dancing, techno

### __ Experience

##### Hydro Capitol, Sales Associate <br> --- 2019 Winter-Spring

served ~30 managers of ~50 accounts, customers and distributors  
troubleshot customer problems/requirements and provided solutions  
learned various brands and the use of their different product lines  
as well as their inventory software and all the inner workings of it  
interacted with teams at other branches biweekly  

##### mc chris, Road Manager <br> --- 2018 Fall

drove 14,000+ miles and arranged lodging in 50+ cities  
sold $100k+ merchandise in venues with capacities from 75-500  
loaded in and out both equipment and merchandise  
did inventory weekly and managed logistics with resuppliers  

##### Solution People, Lead Website Engineer <br> --- 2015-2017
I interned here in college and they kept me on for a couple years after. This business had 30+ websites each angled towards a different market. My job was to make the slight tweaks and updates to each one when new data come out. I did a couple redesigns, combined a few together, split other ones out, wrote a couple of scripts to streamline common methods.

##### Original Graphics Printing, Contractor <br> --- 2015 Summer-Fall
I worked out of a print shop on the south side of Chicago who served a bunch of small local businesses doing visual branding: signs, decals for cars and windows, tshirts, and etc. I was brought on to add a website element to this. Because of the rate at which they acquired new clients, my website game morphed from updating a few dozen sites a couple times a week, to creating a new site from scratch and getting it perfect in a week or two.

##### techomad, Founder <br> --- since 2010
I started this business in college, during my transition out of art school: most of my friends were artists with loads of branding experience, but needed a platform to display and market their craft. Recently my clients have been more small businesses.
